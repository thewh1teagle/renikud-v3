# 5-Minute Training Verification

**Goal**: Train model for ~5 minutes with more data to get meaningful results.

## Steps

1. Generate larger synthetic dataset (20 unique samples × 100 = 2000 samples)
2. Train for ~5 minutes
3. Save checkpoint
4. Quick evaluation

## Commands

```bash
python 005_verify_5min_training.py
```

## Expected Results

- Training runs for ~5 minutes
- Loss decreases significantly
- Checkpoint saved successfully
- Model learns to predict nikud (no [UNK] tokens in next step)

## Duration

~5 minutes of training + ~1 minute overhead = ~6 minutes total
