# Inference Verification

**Goal**: Verify inference works on trained model.

## Steps

1. Load model from checkpoint
2. Run inference on sample texts
3. Verify nikud marks are correctly added
4. Test batch inference
5. Test mixed Hebrew/English text

## Commands

```bash
python 004_verify_inference.py
```

## Expected Results

- Model loads from checkpoint
- Plain Hebrew text gets nikud marks
- Mixed text preserves non-Hebrew characters
- Batch inference works
- Output is valid NFD normalized text
