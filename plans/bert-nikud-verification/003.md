# Training Verification (Mini-Run)

**Goal**: Verify training loop works with a minimal dataset and few steps.

## Steps

1. Create small dataset (50 lines)
2. Initialize model, tokenizer, dataset
3. Run 5 training steps
4. Verify loss decreases
5. Save checkpoint
6. Verify checkpoint can be loaded

## Commands

```bash
# Create small dataset for quick training test
head -n 50 sample_data.txt > train_small.txt

python 003_verify_training.py
```

## Expected Results

- Training starts without errors
- Loss computed for each step
- Gradient updates applied
- Checkpoint saved successfully
- Checkpoint can be loaded
