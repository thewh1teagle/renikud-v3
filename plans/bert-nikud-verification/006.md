# Inference Verification with Trained Model

**Goal**: Test inference on the 5-minute trained model.

## Steps

1. Load model from trained checkpoint
2. Test inference on:
   - Texts seen during training
   - New texts (same words, different order)
   - Mixed Hebrew/English text
3. Verify no [UNK] tokens for seen data

## Commands

```bash
python 006_verify_inference_trained.py
```

## Expected Results

- Model loads from checkpoint
- Training texts produce valid nikud (no [UNK])
- New texts may have some errors but should be readable
- Mixed text preserves non-Hebrew characters

## Duration

~30 seconds
